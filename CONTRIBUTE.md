This module is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials in google Classroom, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the module itself.

## set up your environment 

SEPAL modules are of course meant to work on the sepal plateform so you should use the same [requirements](https://github.com/openforis/sepal/blob/master/modules/geospatial-toolkit/docker/config/requirements.txt) as we use on the prod platform if you work locally. But of course the easyest way is to work directly from [SEPAL](https://sepal.io) !
