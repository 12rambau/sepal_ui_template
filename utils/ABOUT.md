This module is a demonstration application, it has no functional value and the created files will be deleted periodically. 

It presents in 3 panels the typical organization of an application based on the [`sepal_ui`](https://pypi.org/project/sepal-ui/) library.

The library is mainly directed towards geographic data analysis which explains the presence of a built-in AOI selector and a reclassification tool. The last panel shows a 100% python process to display graphs. 

To learn more about the library check out our [documentation](https://sepal-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and have a look at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/12rambau/sepal_ui), we regularly publish new features.
